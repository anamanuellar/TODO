# TODO
To do list

This small project has inspired me to keep my studies. I worked a lot with CSS and Javascript and hope to redo it later to fix some problems like generating scrollbar automatically if it is inserted a number of items bigger than the viewport. Also, I want to code for mobile version using React Native.
